                    One of the greatest pshycological books I found truly astounishing was "The laws of human nature" a book of Robert Green as an author. I could simply say this book is a psychiatrist talking to you and teaching you the behaviours of human beings and how you should react to a certain action. The book certainly doesn't critize but teaches you the ways of humanbeings in a manner where you have to unravel by yourself; its a quite interesting book.
